# Airbnb Berlin data analyzed
This project analyzes Airbnb data from Berlin.


## Motivation

The analysis focusses on three main questions:

- How is the trend of prices in 2019? Are there any peaks?
- How much differs the price in different neighbourhoods?
- Are there any other factors that have an influence on the price?


## Results

The average price is stable throughout the year with the only spike around christmas while prices in different neighbourhoods differs very much. Other factors are mainly size and extra equipment related: a bigger appartment with better equipment costs more.

The full analysis can be read on <TODO: add link>.
